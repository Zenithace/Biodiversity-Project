# Biodiversity-Project
Using Python to interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks and to perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered.
# Project Description
In this project, I analyzed a dataset from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks. The goal was to analyze, clean up, and visualize data to see if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered.
# Data Overview
Data used in this project contained the following columns;

Species info: 
1. **category**: Represents the classes of animals involved in this analysis
2. **scientific_name**: The biological names of each specie of animals
3. **common_names**: The common name of animals conserved or not. 
4. **conservation_status**: Represent the current status of animal's risk of extinction. 

Observations:

5. **scientific_name**: The biologicla name of each specie of animals observed
6. **park_name**: The name of the park where the animals are conserved
7. **observations**: The population of each specie of animals left in each park.
