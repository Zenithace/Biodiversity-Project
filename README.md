# Biodiversity-Project
Using Python to interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks and to perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered.
# Project Description
In this project, I analyzed a dataset from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks. The goal was to analyze, clean up, and visualize data to see if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered.
# Data Overview

The datasets provided have the following columns of data:

***species_info.csv:***

1. **category** - class of animal

2. **scientific_name** - the scientific name of each species

3. **common_name**- the common names of each species

4. **conservation_status** - each speciesâ€™ current conservation status

***observations.csv:***

5. **scientific_name**- the scientific name of each species

6. **park_name**- Park where species were found

7. **observations** - the number of times each species was observed at park
